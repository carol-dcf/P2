## P2 of SCAV subject
In this project you can see applied some functionalities of the ffmpeg software into the BBB video. All the functions can be applied to any other video if the input_path is changed in the main.py file.

To run the program, run the main.py and a fully interactive menu will appear. There, you can navigate trough the different proposed exercises.

Instructions are reaaly clear once you are running the files, however, here's a quick guide on how to use it.

| 1 | Cut video     | Given an input file, you specify (through the command line) how many seconds of the video you want to cut, and in which second you start cutting |
|---|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2 | YUV histogram | Given an input file, overlay frame by frame the YUV histogram generated on it. |
| 3 | Resize video  | Given an input file, resize the video into 4 different outputs of differents sizes and resolutions (720p, 480p, 360x240, 160x120).               |
| 4 | Change audio  | Given an input file, convert its audio to mono and change the type of audio codec used (e.g. mp3, aac...) (especified through the command line). |
| 0 | Exit          | Close application. |

(All the files generated in the different exercises on the BBB video can be seen in the Results folder)
