In this project you can see applied some functionalities of the ffmpeg software into the BBB video. All the functions can be applied to any other video if the input_path is changed in the main.py file.

To run the program, run the main.py and a fully interactive menu will appear. There, you can navigate trough the different proposed exercises.

Instructions are reaaly clear once you are running the files, however, here's a quick guide on how to use it.

| Num | Title         | Short explanation of the function                                                                                                                |
|-----|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Cut video     | Given an input file, you specify (through the command line) how many seconds of the video you want to cut, and in which second you start cutting |
| 2   | YUV histogram | Given an input file, overlay frame by frame the YUV histogram generated on it. |
| 3   | Resize video  | Given an input file, resize the video into 4 different outputs of differents sizes and resolutions (720p, 480p, 360x240, 160x120).               |
| 4   | Change audio  | Given an input file, convert its audio to mono and change the type of audio codec used (e.g. mp3, aac...) (especified through the command line). |
| 0   | Exit          | Close application. |

(All the files generated in the different exercises on the BBB video can be seen in the Results folder)
